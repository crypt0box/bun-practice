ðŸš€ Bun Dev Container
---------------------

This repository provides a development environment for [Bun](https://bun.sh/) using Visual Studio Code's [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/).

## About Bun

Bun is a fast JavaScript all-in-one toolkit designed for developing, testing, running, and bundling JavaScript and TypeScript projects.
This Dev Container setup streamlines the development process by providing a pre-configured environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nhaef/devcontainer-bun.git
```

Open the repository in Visual Studio Code:

```bash
cd devcontainer-bun
code .
```

Visual Studio Code should prompt you to reopen the project in a Dev Container.
Accept the prompt to set up the development environment inside a Docker container.
Once the Dev Container is built and started, you'll have a fully configured environment for Bun development.
